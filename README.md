# Random Star Trek Media Picker

<div align="center">
 Too much Star Trek too little time? Don't know what Movie/Episode to pick? Then this is the program for you! 
 <br>
 </br>
 This is a simple Python program that randomly picks from any Official Star Trek Movie or TV Show.
 </br>
 (No GUI, command line only)
 <br>
 </br>
 Just simply pick a Media Type then pick a Series!

 (This program is based on the the randomizer that currently exists on http://people.duke.edu/~noor/trek.html, written in JS)
