 Too much Star Trek too little time? Don't know what Movie/Episode to pick? Then this is the program for you!

 </br>
 This is a simple Python program that randomly picks from any Official Star Trek Movie or TV Show.

 Simply choose a <b>Media Type</b> then choose a <b>Series</b> or just choose <b>I'm Feeling Lucky</b> to get anything!
